# Kudos Docs Website

This site is hosted on github pages and is generated by [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and [mkdocs-material](https://hub.docker.com/r/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/)

The static files for the website are served out from the `gh-pages` branch. They are automatically generated and committed by `mk-docs`.

A Jenkins hook automatically builds and deploys this repository on any push to the master branch. Therefore removing the need to set up local dev environments for contributing to the documentation.

## Making Changes, adding pages, etc

Directly commit any changes to the master branch to publish a new version of the website. This includes editing md files or config (in `mkdocs.yml`) and adding new pages and assets.

## Deploying Changes Manually
