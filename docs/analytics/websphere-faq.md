# Huddo Analytics Installation FAQ

### Installation

#### Images do not work
Please go to the BadgesConfigurator->Settings tab then restart the Huddo Application.

#### Scheduler not running
Issue is with the timerManager in WAS. [Create a new one to resolve issue](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/asyncbns/tasks/tasb_timemanager.html).

#### Performance tuning
Review [this guide](/assets/analytics/Huddo%20Analytics%20Tuning.pdf) for changes that can be made.
