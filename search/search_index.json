Kudos Badges for Connections is a flexible gamification engine for Connections. By providing achievements and rewards (Kudos Badges), rank and leaderboards (Kudos Rank), and missions (Kudos Missions), organisations can dramatically improve their user engagement and adoption of Connections. In addition, Kudos Badges is an extensible platform that can leverage game theory to provide performance management mechanics and reward systems for applications outside of Connections such as HR, Sales Force Management, Help Desks, and many more. Kudos also now includes a peer to peer and team recognition feature; Kudos Thanks. Kudos Points \u00b6 Kudos Points are awarded to people for performing certain actions. For example you get a Kudos Point for posting a status update or making a comment. You get 5 Kudos Points for creating a blog, or 3 Kudos Points for having one of your files recommended by another person. You can even be awarded Kudos Points for achieving a particular badge or for completing a Kudos Mission or category of badges. The value of any particular action or reward can be configured so the points system can be tweaked to meet your needs. You can also be awarded Kudos Points for your actions outside of Connections helping to drive your organisations\u2019 performance management. Kudos Metrics \u00b6 Metrics are at the heart of Kudos Badges. Metrics are basically a way of awarding and tracking Kudos that determine if a particular badge, mission, or achievement has been awarded. Metrics also award Kudos that add to the person\u2019s Kudos Rank and their leaderboard position. Metrics are SQL statements that analyse information in your database. You can even define Metrics that count other Metrics! We provide many out of the box metrics for Connections that you can add to or modify. In addition you can also build your own custom metrics that capture actions and performance from external applications. You can then reward users based on their actions and behaviour outside of Connections. Kudos Filters \u00b6 Filters work alongside Metrics. Filters are also SQL statements, and they are applied to Metrics to, as the name suggests, filter the selected users using contextual parameters such as Time, Community, Name etc. For example, to select a user with the display name Joe Bloggs, we can use the Profile Like Metric with the filter Display Name Like with its parameter set to \u2018Joe Bloggs \u2019 . Like Metrics, we also provide many out of the box filters for Connections that you can modify or add to, and you can build your own custom filters for use with external applications. Kudos Badges \u00b6 Kudos Badges are rewards that users receive for performing certain actions. There are simple badges that are fairly easy to achieve and more complex badges that require significant effort. The Kudos Badges are designed to not only reward users but to also encourage progression and exploration of other features. Badges are grouped into categories and missions and are achieved by meeting the required metrics for each badge. Badges are defined by selecting pre-configured Metrics, and specifying the upper and lower limits of the Kudos points returned by these Metrics, required to achieve that Badge. You can make Badges as simple or as complex as you wish by varying the amount of Metrics you are counting. Kudos Awards \u00b6 Kudos Awards is a reward and recognition system which provides the capability of directly awarding Badges to one or more users. Kudos provides a set of default Awards to reward loyalty, efficiency, expertise, etc. The default Awards have been designed to be generic and universally applicable, however they can be customised and/or replaced with ones more applicable to your environment. Kudos Leaderboard \u00b6 The Kudos Badges Leaderboard enables users to view the top 10 contributors throughout Connections. You can filter the leaders to just people from your network, everyone, or even Community members (when viewing the Kudos Leaderboard in a Community). You can also view a break-down of which categories the Points/Badges came from by simply selecting the user in the Leaderboard. Kudos Configurators \u00b6 The Kudos Badges, Metrics & Filters Configurators allow the user to control and customise Badges, Metrics & Filters. These Configurators are designed for use by Administrators, and not general users. As such controlling access to them is very important. Therefore we have built them to only operate in one specific Connections Community, which you can control. This means that the Community Administrators use the Members list to specify the users allowed access to each Configurator. We will be creating three Communities; one for each Configurator. These Communities can be Stand-alone Communities or Sub-Communities of existing Communities if you wish. Kudos Badges Summary \u00b6 The Kudos Summary Widget is added to everyone's profile so that others can see what achievements and rewards the person has received. When you mouse over each badge it provides you with details on why the badge was awarded and tasks that you can consider to try and win another badge! The idea is to not only reward people for their behaviour but to also provide them with guidance and education on what else they can do in Connections. When users click on the View All link it takes them to their Kudos Badges Progress and Detail Page. Kudos Profile Progress Widget \u00b6 Encourage the users to get started in Connections! The Profile Progress Widget displays a progress bar indicating a Profile\u2019s maturity level and gives users ideas to improve it based on what the Profile is lacking. This widget uses existing metrics to measure in real-time the level of completion of a Profile. What makes this feature really powerful is that it is completely configurable allowing you to fine tune it to your environment! Kudos Thanks \u00b6 There is nothing quite as simple as saying \"Thank You\" to provide some recognition of great work. Think about it for a moment...when somebody thanks you for your great idea, or for putting in that extra work to meet a deadline, or maybe for just being a good team mate, it makes you feel great and more motivated to stay engaged. That is why ISW has developed Kudos Thanks, the peer to peer and team recognition tool for Connections. Motivate your team We all do performance reviews (or we all should!), however often the problem is that the various achievements or small goals we meet throughout the year can be easily forgotten. Why wait for the next big meeting to provide some feedback to your team. Kudos Thanks enables you to provide real time feedback and to publically acknowledge great work quickly and easily. The recognition then stays visible on the person's profile so that peers and colleagues can see and recognise the value that is placed on a person\u2019s work. Peer to Peer recognition Thanks don\u2019t always come from your boss either! Often having your direct peers\u2019 thank you for some great work can be a great motivator. With Kudos Thanks users of Connections can select from a range of Thanks related badges, choose who to award the thanks to, add a message and send it off! The thanks will appear on the users profile as well as integrate within their Activity Steam so that others can see as well. Management or Team recognition Kudos also allows for Manager or Team Leader Thanks Badges. You can create your own special badges that only certain people can award such as employee of the month. And because Kudos Thanks is built to be social, within Connections peers and colleagues are able to see and add value to the recognition and thanks as well! Thanks Badges Select from provided badges or create your own. You can even set how often a Thanks badge may be awarded to add more value. Personalised Messages & Reputation You can provide a personal message of recognition when awarding a thanks badge. Thanks Received and Given remain on your profile so the recognition you receive is not forgotten. Thanks Allowance Control how often a Thanks badge may be awarded to add more value and create a greater impact. Social Recognition & Notifications Thanks given to users are published in the Discover Feed for everyone to see. An email notification is sent to the user as well to make sure they receive your thanks. Kudos Groups \u00b6 Kudos Groups allows administrators to group users. These groups can then be used to control access to various parts of Kudos. For example in Thanks Badges, allowing you to define Thanks which can only be awarded by selected users. This allows you to define exclusive Management badges such as \u201cEmployee of the Month\u201d which can only be awarded by those you choose! You can also use Groups to exclude users from appearing in the Leaderboards! Connections Activity Stream Integration \u00b6 Kudos now includes Embedded Experiences in the Activity Stream through use of the new Open Social Gadget standards. Now you can enjoy a richer Kudos experience, through the ability to Comment & Like on Awarded Badges and Thanks. Awarded Badges All awarded badges will now appear on the Discovery tab in the Activity Stream. Further details about the Badge can be viewed by opening the Embedded Kudos Gadget. Kudos News Gadget From the Kudos News Gadget users can now Like and Comment on Kudos Activity Stream Entries. Liking Kudos Entries When a User Likes the item, a new entry describing the Liking of the Content, is created in the Activity Stream and the original entry is rolled up into the new entry. If the user chooses to Undo this Like, then this new Stream Entry is removed and the previous Entry takes its place again. Commenting on Kudos Entries When a User Comments on the item, a new entry describing the Comment on the Content, is created in the Activity Stream and any previous entries are rolled up into the new entry. If the user chooses to remove this Comment, then the new Stream Entry is removed and the previous Entry takes its place again. Users can also edit their own comments after posting to correct any mistakes quickly and easily. Recent Updates All activity performed on the Stream Entries can be viewed on the Recent Updates tab of the Kudos News Gadget. This includes the creation of the original entry as well as all comments and likes on the entry. This allows you to see who responded and when. To make things even simpler, all timestamps are updated in real time, so you are never misinformed! Thanks Given All Thanks given by users will now appear in the Discovery tab in the Activity Stream. Further details about the Thanks, including the personal message of recognition, can be seen by opening the Embedded Kudos News Gadget. Thanks Email Notifications Users receiving Thanks will also be notified by email. Details about the Thanks, including the personal message of recognition, are included in this email.","title":"Details"},{"location":"badges/#kudos-points","text":"Kudos Points are awarded to people for performing certain actions.

How to use the Timeline \u00b6 Whether you\u2019re starting a new board, or using an existing board, for cards to appear on the timeline, they\u2019ll need to have a start and finish date. From the Timeline view, these dates can be added in two ways: Drag and Drop Unscheduled Cards If you have cards that are sitting in the Unscheduled Cards area on the bottom right-hand side, you can drag and drop them on to the timeline. To begin, cards can only be dropped in to the list they have been created in and will by default, be allocated to three days from start to finish. Once you\u2019ve dropped a card in to its list, you can move it along the timeline in either direction, shorten or lengthen its start and finish dates, or move to a different list. Add Start and Finish Dates to a Card Cards sitting in the Unscheduled Cards area can be clicked on to bring up the detailed card view. From here, select Set Dates , from the right-hand side menu. Add in a start and finish date under the card title for it to appear on the Timeline. The finish date will automatically fill to three days after start date, but this can be edited. Note: In the Kanban Board view or Mind Map view, you also have the option to add dates to cards, by clicking in to the detailed card view, selecting Set Dates, and adding a Start Date and End Date. If you then switch over to the Timeline view, your cards will automatically fall on the timeline to the dates you have selected.

Configuring the Application \u00b6 Licence Key \u00b6 Without a licence applied, the application can only be used in test mode, where files and folders are reported but not actually migrated. When requesting a licence you will need to supply: The domain name used to access the application in the browser. For limited (demo) licences: The community UUIDs that will be allowed to migrate their files. After receiving your key, you will need to create name space bindings for CMM Migrator using the exact values provided by the Kudos team. All licenced installs require iswCCMLicenceKey .

On first use in any single browser session, you should switch to the \"API Settings\" page to check the default configuration, and update this configuration if required for your environment. In particular, you may need to change the \"Destination Domain\" if you run the app in your source Connections environment and need to migrate to a separate environment. Once configured as required, return to the \"Home\" page and click \"Analyze Communities\" to initiate the process. Depending on the size of your environment, the analysis may take some time. Once complete, the list of Communities will be displayed. This includes filtering that defaults to show only Communities valid for migration from CCM to Files. Current details for quota and current size of Files within each Community is shown. Test mode is provided to give an analysis of the Library prior to the actual migration. Note that a licence key is required to disable test mode and perform a real migration, and the licence key (if provided to you) must be installed as described in the \"Configuring the Application\" section of this document. To migrate one or more Communities CCM to Files, select the checkbox next to each Community name and click \"Migrate Communities\". (Test mode should be disabled for the actual migration.) The status log will provide details while processing, showing all Library files and Files folders during the migration set-up (if test mode is selected this is where the process ends). Details are provided for each file processed as files and folders are migrated to Files. Once a Migration run has completed an entry will be logged showing a summary of each Community processed and the files and folders found within CCM along with those created in Files. This log file is saved under the \"Temporary Files Storage\" location. The detailed log is cleared when starting each new analysis, if required, for this log should be manually copied from the page prior to refreshing or closing. The process of analysis can be re-started by refreshing the page, however, as noted above, this will clear the detailed log. Regarding file name conflicts \u00b6 When migrating files, the application makes some attempt to work around file name conflicts. This is particularly worth noting when either: One CCM library has files of the same name in different folders; or One community has two or more CCM libraries with files of the same name. IBM Connections Files permits files of the same name in different folders, but doesn't permit a top-level file (not in any folders) to have the same name as a file in a folder. By default, if the CCM Migrator tries to migrate a file and finds that there is already a file of that name in Community Files, it will rename the new migrated file by appending an underscore (_) followed by a number. It will use the number 2 for the first renamed file, increasing the number if the first rename also produces a conflict, and will try up to 20 renames on each conflicting file before giving up. For example, if the file name \"My Document.doc\" conflicts with an existing Community File, it will be renamed to \"My Document_2.doc\". Additionally, for each community, the application checks whether a migration was previously attempted for that community, and avoids repeatedly migrating files which were previously migrated. This means that if a migration of one community was partially successful, but some error prevented completion, the error can be fixed and the migration repeated without having to clear out previously migrated files or producing duplicates. Important: Migrations performed before this functionality was added to CCM Migrator (on 11 Feb 2019) will not be detected, due to the reliance on a new style of system logging. The application's user-interface provides some options to change the above behaviour, as follows: Migrate each community from scratch \u2013 The default (disabled) state detects whether files were migrated for each community in a previous run, to prevent repeatedly migrating the same files. Enabling this options prevents such detection. This will probably never be necessary. Rename files to avoid name conflicts \u2013 The default (Yes) option causes conflicting files to be renamed as described above. Select \"No\" to prevent renaming files, and therefore prevent migrating files with conflicting names. Maximum number of renames per file \u2013 The number of times to try renaming each conflicting file. Defaults to 20, but any number from 1 to 100 is valid. Ignored if the previous option is \"No\". Prefix text before number for renamed files \u2013 The text separating a file's original name from the number, for any files renamed due to conflicts. Defaults to underscore (_), but can be longer than one character if desired.","title":"Usage"},{"location":"ccm-migrator/usage/#using-the-application","text":"The application can be accessed from your IBM Connections site using the extension: {connections domain}/isw-connections-ccm/ The application initially loads on its \"Home\" page, ready to use with default configuration.

ISW recommends that the minimum number of servers you should start with is 4, being one for the NFS server and http gateway and 3 swarm managers. You may start with small VMs to set this up and expand them as your need increases (either by extending cores and ram on the existing servers or by adding more manager/worker nodes to your swarm). This document will assume the following setup: Gateway server (CentOS) 3 Swarm managers (CoreOS) If you have more managers or workers just extend the config where indicated below. If you are testing this setup, you can get away with quite small servers (we have had success with 2 cores and 1.7gb ram) however if you plan to include the logging and/or monitoring services then you should expect to dedicate an additional 1gb ram minimum for each of these sevices. The Gateway Server will be used for storing all persistent data in nfs shares, if you are setting this environment up for a production system then you should ensure that you have a suitably performant disk for the path /data on this server, you should also ensure that this folder is backed up appropriately. Test Small (<1000 users) Large (>1000 users) Gateway 1 1 1 Managers 3 3 3 Workers 0 0 1 per extra 5000 users Memory 2GB 4GB 8GB CPU 2 2 4 Disk (Nodes) 20GB 40GB 100GB min Disk (Gateway) 40GB 200GB 1000GB min Network setup \u00b6 The setup below will establish some internal networking rules to help protect your environment. When configuring the servers, you will need to enable the following network rules: http(s) traffic should be allowed to the Gateway only ssh traffic should be allowed to all servers Where possible all servers should be on an additional (internal only) subnet, this allows us to further lock down access to NFS shares If you have access to the servers from your local machine then you can run the scripts directly, however if this is not the case then you will need to use an ssh jump box as depicted below. Setup Ansible \u00b6 See Ansible setup guide . Download and extract This zip file to a convenient location, you will run the ansible scripts below from this directory. SSL setup \u00b6 There are four domains in this guide that will require certificates, these can be covered by a single wildcard certificate or by individual certificates. boards.example.com boards-api.example.com portainer.example.com proxy.swarm.example.com (optional traefik proxy dashboard) You will need to obtain pem encoded certificates (including any required intermediate certificates) and keys for these domains. These should be named alike (e.g. boards.crt and boards.key). Place all the certificates and keys in the directory ansible/roles/docker-swarm/files/ssl/ . Server access \u00b6 Ansible uses ssh to communicate with the servers so you'll need to be able to access them from your shell directly. The ideal way to achieve this is to setup key based authentication, however there are workarounds that can be done if you have to use password based authentication. For more info on setting up an ssh private key, see this tutorial As mentioned in the linked article, we will need to add each of our servers to our local list of known hosts, this is done by manually connecting to each of them for our shell. ssh -i path/to/keyfile <username>@<server_ip> e.g. ssh -i /home/nicky/.ssh/id_rsa nicky@10.10.10.1 Config \u00b6 Download this hosts file , save it in the hosts directory and update the values as follows: Key Description all.hosts.gateway.ansible_host IP For Gateway server accessible from your machine all.hosts.nfs_server.ansible_host IP For Gateway server accessible from your machine all.hosts.nfs_server.internal_ip internal IP For Gateway server, if you do not have an internal subnet, use the same IP as above all.hosts.manager(1,2,3).ansible_host IP For Manager node accessible from your machine all.hosts.manager(1,2,3).internal_ip internal IP For Manager node, if you do not have an internal subnet, use the same IP as above all.vars.ansible_user Your username on all servers all.vars.ansible_ssh_private_key_file Full path to your keyfile (leave blank if using password auth) all.vars.swarm_ip_mask ip mask that matches your internal subnet e.g. 10.10.10.10/24, or that matches all swarm nodes if you do not have an internal subnet all.vars.ssl_certs The names of all SSL certificates as defined above all.vars.dashboard_host The domain name for your portainer dashboard all.vars.proxy_dashboard_host The domain name for your traefik proxy dashboard all.vars.monitoring This section will be covered in Advanced below, you should get the swarm up and running first before adding monitoring all.children This section of the config file is for defining where your nodes will sit, please follow the instructions provided in the file itself, adding all nodes to the coreos group, and managers and workers to their respective groups Deploy \u00b6 Save your config file in the hosts directory run the deploy playbook: ansible-playbook -i hosts/servers.yml deploy.yml -v Update DNS records \u00b6 Ensure that DNS records for your portainer dashbaord and traefik dashboard as defined in your config file are pointing to your Gateway server Portainer Setup \u00b6 Open Dashboard as defined in {{dashboard_host}} above Create admin user when prompted Add Dockerhub auth Open Registries Tick Authentication add Username, Password Storage (Mongo & S3) \u00b6 Kudos Boards requires a Mongo database and an S3 object store.

When configuring the servers, you will need to enable the following network rules: http(s) traffic should be allowed to the Gateway only ssh traffic should be allowed to all servers Where possible all servers should be on an additional (internal only) subnet, this allows us to further lock down access to NFS shares If you have access to the servers from your local machine then you can run the scripts directly, however if this is not the case then you will need to use an ssh jump box as depicted below.","title":"Network setup"},{"location":"swarm/#setup-ansible","text":"See Ansible setup guide .
